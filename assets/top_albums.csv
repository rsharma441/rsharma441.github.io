1,brat,Charli XCX,Pop,"This is the longest and most vulnerable of my reviews, but the most meaningful, so if you’d like to get to know me better, please do read it! I was set to crown Nala Sinephro’s album as the best of the year; I’d never experienced brilliance like its before. But after a trip to London a few weeks ago, I realized it had to be brat. It’s not just a great album; it’s a mirror to my life and my identity struggles. \n\nI was in London– ironic.  My earliest identity was as someone who challenged the British. From the start, I was force fed deep pride in resisting the Anglo oppressor—by both India and America. I was taught that life’s transience demands challenging the status quo, that revolution is always on the table. This became my identity—to be progressive, to fight, to seek the new and indie. I love it, but being that fluid left me as a “man without a country.\n\nBeing Indian in America didn’t help. People couldn’t pronounce my name. My language sounded weird. I wasn’t Christian. I couldn’t invite people to my smelly house. I looked around and saw Black and Hispanic people being celebrated for their “coolness,” and East Asians adopting white names to blend in. 9/11 surely didn’t help. Lack of TV role models? What if every TV character was a joke– not funny, a joke. I’ll never have a memory before feeling insecure. It’s always been. Not feeling like I have to prove to everyone why I’m worth being seen, or heard or even existing.\n\nUntil I was about 27, I buried my insecurity and used knowledge and comedy to make myself feel valuable. I became the guy who could make jokes about brownness that no one else could, who knew random facts and about anything to start a meaningful chat with anyone. Why pick up so many random skills? Why do I travel so much– and choose the timeless icon bar over the trendy lounge? It was all to stay connected to people meaningfully, to know their lives and history and culture intimately, to prove I was worth their attention and make them feel real joy near me. Without that, I felt like I’d just be the butt of the joke.\n\nI was terrified of making anyone uncomfortable. I missed chances to connect—never telling the pretty girls how I felt, avoiding confrontations with bullies, lying to my family. For years, my insecurity sabotaged relationships. I pushed people away, letting my fear hurt them. Deliberately pushing them away to stop feeling like an imposter and kill the relationship. I’m so sorry. If you’re holding onto those moments, please reach out so we can talk.\n\nTruth is, as some of you know, I was one poorly tied knot away from not making it. Had it not been for music, I probably wouldn’t have. It helped me heal by helping me feel understood then and I started making these lists in 2009 as gratitude. Music is an enigma, but it helps us connect to the world in ways words or pictures can’t. Funny though– my earliest identity was shaped by rejecting the British, who would I be without British music? The first album I remember hearing was When I Was Born for the 7th Time; The first song I thought was cool was Guns of Brixton; I learned guitar so I could play The Bends; My favorite song is This Charming Man; I was glued to TV watching the power of Geldof’s Live 8; I’ll never stop dancing thanks to Jamie XX; David Bowie was who I modeled my entire persona off of.\n\nWhen I got here, London, and heard Charli everywhere—every club, every shop—it hit me. This was the people’s music: a progressive, radical, brown woman, living a mixed identity, emotional, wanting to talk about her feelings but still craving the party, wanting to make people laugh, trying to fit in yet stand out, silly, serious, confident, vulnerable, insecure—this was everything I felt but couldn’t always express. To hear it celebrated across the city, made me cry. It was them; it was her—and it was me. Charli had woven together all those pieces, just as I had, and created something that connected her to everyone. It was a beautiful reflection of how we both tried to bridge our worlds, and it resonated with people in a way that gave me the deepest sense of belonging.\n\nRecently, I’ve realized that my pursuits—travel, hobbies, experiences—were all about one thing: connecting with others. Despite an insecure motivation, that is my identity, and I’m finally proud of being a connector. But brat showed me something even deeper: I don’t need to rid myself of my insecurity. It’s my strength. Without it, I’d live a much duller life, less driven to grow. It’ll never fully go away, and I shouldn’t want it to. I need to control it, but never wish it away, because it’s what keeps me evolving, reaching for more, and truly connecting. Thank you, Charli, it’s been a brat life.
