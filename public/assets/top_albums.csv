SAYA,Saya Gray,"Experimental Pop, Indie","I was absolutely blown away by this album the second I heard it. SAYA is music mastery. This album hit me because it sounds like someone thinking in real time, musically. Saya Gray doesn’t treat songs as finished objects so much as active systems—chord progressions get interrupted, grooves collapse and restart, guitars drift out of key, vocals are stacked or stripped away mid-phrase. You can hear the studio as an instrument here: edits are left audible, transitions feel deliberate but unresolved, and the production constantly shifts perspective, like you’re moving around the room with her.

This album also landed during a year where I’ve been unlearning a lot—about work, ambition, and what I actually want to do with my time. I’ve spent less time believing in systems that promise optimization and more time reconnecting with my earliest sense of self-- in art, hosting, music, storytelling, and shared experience. SAYA feels aligned with that shift. It doesn’t tell you what to think or how to feel; it gives you space to notice yourself in the process of deciding. In a moment where we’re rushing to automate meaning and optimize intimacy, this album quietly insists that there’s no substitute for presence. It reminded me that connection takes time, that insecurity often powers the systems we complain about, and that reclaiming agency doesn’t always come from louder resistance—but from curiosity and choosing to stay with complexity a little longer. More than anything else this year, SAYA felt alive, unfinished, and human in exactly the ways I needed. Thank you Saya Gray, and thank you everyone!

One Battle After Another,Jonny Greenwood,"Experimental, Classical, Soundtrack","Jonny Greenwood is the reason I own a Telecaster and arguably my most listened-to artist of all time. I love almost everything he does, but this project felt different. He’s always experimenting, yet here it felt like a mastercraft, pulling together so many threads from across his past work into something focused and intentional. The album leans into repetition, limited harmony, and slow variation, drawing more from minimalist composition than traditional scoring. Strings, percussion, and electronics are used carefully to build pressure over time, never rushing toward resolution. I kept coming back to it when my brain needed structure more than comfort. Over time it stopped feeling like an album and started feeling like a framework I was living inside",Steve Reich; Philip Glass; Hildur Guðnadóttir; Jóhann Jóhannsson; Radiohead,https://open.spotify.com/album/3CHjGTx0GVPEVb52RxM1IO?si=U2qZcf02SDe0ptxN6ViG3g,https://www.nonesuch.com/sites/g/files/g2000014771/files/styles/album_detail__545___545_/public/2025-09/jonny-greenwood-one-battle-after-another-545.jpg?itok=o0f32bEL
Hallucinating Love,Maribou State,"Electronic, Downtempo","Maribou State are a UK duo who helped define the warmer, more human side of modern electronic music, bridging club culture with songwriting, live instrumentation, and emotional openness.  Hallucinating Love captures the emotional tone I wanted to convey this year. It chooses care over collapse and connection over spectacle. It feels shaped by a moment where people were tired, overwhelmed, and still trying to reach for joy, intimacy, and something steady to hold onto.After a six-year gap following Kingdoms in Colour—marked by health struggles, burnout, and personal upheaval—Chris Davids and Liam Ivory came back with music that feels open, patient, and emotionally present. Songs like “Blackoak,” “Otherside,” and “Bloom” blend live percussion, melodic synths, and organic instrumentation into something immersive without being overwhelming.

LUX,Rosalía,Avant-Pop,"The level of intention on this album is almost overwhelming. Rosalía and her collaborators move confidently between classical phrasing, experimental sound design, and pop songwriting, and every decision feels deliberate. Vocals are treated as instruments, sometimes pristine, sometimes fractured, always controlled. Even when I wasn’t emotionally inside the record, I couldn’t ignore the craft and discipline behind it. It felt less like an album to live in and more like an artistic statement to stand in front of and take seriously.",Björk; Arca; Frank Ocean; Sevdaliza; James Blake,https://open.spotify.com/album/3SUEJULSGgBDG1j4GQhfYY?si=3PzHfP-2RHSGpiXtvOuHcg,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a1/Rosal%C3%ADa_%E2%80%93_Lux_%28album_cover%29.png/250px-Rosal%C3%ADa_%E2%80%93_Lux_%28album_cover%29.png
The Smashing Machine,Nala Sinephro,"Ambient Jazz, Soundtrack","Listening to this felt like stepping into a calmer room. Harp, synths, and ensemble playing are used with restraint and patience. The musicianship is excellent but never flashy. I reached for this late at night or on long walks.",Alice Coltrane; Floating Points; Laraaji; Pharoah Sanders; Carlos Niño,https://open.spotify.com/album/3LPmqGCKhFHS5Fw8WyaKY8?si=CCGFn8_iRBWb6ZLro9AV_A,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/9c/Nala_Sinephro_-_The_Smashing_Machine_cover.png
Debí Tirar Más Fotos,Bad Bunny,Reggaeton,"This album is an act of resistance. Seeing it performed during his Puerto Rico residency only reinforced what was already there: a deliberate choice to center place, memory, and dignity while holding enormous power. The reggaeton frameworks remain, but they’re slowed and weighted with intention, like a refusal to rush or dilute the message. It felt rare and energizing to watch an artist at this scale use his reach to defend culture rather than extract from it.",Tego Calderón; Calle 13; Frank Ocean; Prince; Ivy Queen,https://open.spotify.com/album/5K79FLRUCSysQnVESLcTdb?si=PDX_HSY-QNu2Sq3138ICrQ,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ef/Bad_Bunny_-_Deb%C3%AD_Tirar_M%C3%A1s_Fotos.png
You Are the Morning,jasmine.4.t,"Indie, Pop","This album is built around care and closeness. jasmine.4.t recorded it with a small, trusted circle, keeping arrangements sparse so the focus stays on voice, lyrics, and emotional pacing. It feels intimate without being fragile, like songs meant to be shared quietly rather than performed outward.",Adrianne Lenker; Nick Drake; Florist; Julie Byrne; Laura Marling,https://open.spotify.com/album/4amlS1zcZeSWkphaXn3lEq?si=sA2YMVSYQMaojJYTxVEdNQ,https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a0233515030_10.jpg
Humanhood,The Weather Station,"Indie Folk, Art Rock","Humanhood feels like the sound of someone trying to make sense of a world that keeps shifting underfoot. Tamara Lindeman and her band recorded in Toronto with a mix of acoustic instruments, woodwinds, electronics, and improvisational interplay that gives the album both warmth and tension. The songs move between folk-leaning lyricism and subtle experimental textures, with moments like “Irreversible Damage” weaving voice, saxophone, and synth into something almost conversational in feel.",Joni Mitchell; Talk Talk; Big Thief; Julia Holter; R.E.M.,https://open.spotify.com/album/5oiIdyuDWZ9einLEUdAccO?si=Jd_z7OczQOymzSg8GslBtw,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/1e/Humanhood_%E2%80%93_The_Weather_Station.png
forever,bassvictim,"Electronic, Hyperpop","On Forever, Bassvictim lean into a shift from chaotic “basspunk” toward something more cohesive and adventurous, blending glitched electronics with melodic ideas and unexpected instrumentation. Tracks like “Ike Piano” reveal a softer side built from delay-soaked piano and layered vocals that feel oddly comforting amid the glitch and bitcrush. The duo’s energy is part hedonistic art-scene edge and part genuine musical play! ",Two Shell; SOPHIE; A. G.

"Patience, Moonbeam",Great Grandpa,Indie Rock,Restraint does a lot of the work here. The band avoids over-arranging and lets dynamics carry the emotion. Production keeps everything close and grounded. It grew on me over time.,Big Thief; Hop Along; Wilco; Pinegrove; Built to Spill,https://open.spotify.com/album/0cEVL87PbprdLn7E8Fs8ct?si=yWpjToxuTqCZkqHXvjweEQ,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/0/0a/Great_Grandpa_%E2%80%93_Patience%2C_Moonbeam.jpg/250px-Great_Grandpa_%E2%80%93_Patience%2C_Moonbeam.jpg
Wishful Thinking,duval timothy,"Ambient, Neo-Classical","This record rewards stillness. Duval Timothy uses piano fragments, negative space, and soft ambient textures in a way that feels intentional rather than minimal for its own sake. There’s a patience to the pacing that lets emotion surface slowly, without being directed. I returned to it when I needed room to think or feel without being told what to feel, and that quiet trust is what made it stick.",Brian Eno; Nils Frahm; Hania Rani; Harold Budd; Laraaji,https://open.spotify.com/album/7AzqzYUtZhGnQA2gnM6wXz?si=jlXh6_5LSq-wGaZYZWDmMw,https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1772736984_10.jpg
True Electric,Röyksopp,Electronic,"hat makes this album special is how it reworks music I’ve loved for over a decade into new shapes, new mixes, and new energy without losing its core. The synth lines are still melodic and emotional, but the production feels bigger, cleaner, and more alive in a modern context. It feels like watching artists who know their catalog inside and out breathe new life into it rather than trying to outrun it. Confident, generous, and deeply satisfying.",Depeche Mode; New Order; Underworld; Moderat; Kraftwerk,https://open.spotify.com/album/1W0n7wveEKHP3yqZjrbJCg?si=Frp2OJ_nSdW2gxaiOiN8-g,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/7/73/True_Electric.jpg/250px-True_Electric.jpg
EARTHBREAKS,South Hill Experiment,"Electronic, Experimental",Environment matters more than individual tracks here. Layers of sound build gradually and reveal themselves over time.

ONDATONDA,Ceri Wax,Electronic,"This album feels loose in a way that’s intentional. Ceri Wax leans into playful rhythms, off-kilter grooves, and slightly messy textures that keep the music feeling alive rather than overworked. The production favors swing, surprise making it feel like an interesting conversation.",DJ Koze; Avalon Emerson; Palms Trax; Midland; Floorplan,https://open.spotify.com/album/6ugAB2uGoZ5YrqKoS5ycbG?si=rJ6Inw9AQum3K7WQZAqLeQ,https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3355908737_10.jpg
Getting Killed,Geese,Indie Rock,"It was incredible to witness what this album did to NYC this year. Seeing Geese live around the city made it clear this wasn’t just a record, it was a loose movement forming around chaos, humor, and sweat-soaked shows. The raw production and breakneck pacing matched the energy of packed rooms and people yelling every word back.

A Paradise in the Hold,Yazz Ahmed,"Jazz, Arabic Folk","Yazz Ahmed’s fourth album feels like a musical exploration of belonging and heritage. Drawing from her British-Bahraini background and folk traditions like pearl-diver songs and Gulf rhythms, she weaves Arabic modal inflections into jazz frameworks with real confidence, bringing myth and memory into the present. The combination of flugelhorn, layered vocals, and shifting rhythmic patterns reflects her dual identity and the complexity of cultural translation. Collaborators like Natacha Atlas and a wide ensemble of instrumentalists add depth without overshadowing Ahmed’s vision.

Racing Mount Pleasant,Racing Mount Pleasant,Indie Rock,"This album feels patient and lived-in. The band leans into layered arrangements with guitars, keys, and subtle orchestration that slowly build rather than rush toward payoff. There’s a quiet confidence in how the songs unfold, letting repetition and small shifts carry the emotion. It reminded me of records that trust the listener to stay with them instead of grabbing for attention. Nothing here shouts, but a lot of it lingers.",R.E.M.; Low; Big Thief; Real Estate; Yo La Tengo,https://open.spotify.com/album/037axs2AfEPUD5LtjfFYSv?si=JarvvQKJRD-WYag71TIIfA,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c1/Racing_Mount_Pleasant_album_cover.jpg
DJ Set,Mouseatouille,Indie Rock,"Mouseatouille’s DJ Set feels like a warm, ramshackle get-together you’re invited into. The nine-piece band spent years recording in living rooms, DIY spaces, and sharehouses, and that blend of intimacy and spontaneity shows up in the music with woodwinds, clarinet, piano, and group vocals weaving in and out.",Broken Social Scene; Sufjan Stevens; Belle and Sebastian; The Microphones; Arcade Fire,https://open.spotify.com/album/29Xl0gLS3K9IMhJMLl3O1u?si=xoaJYAE-TDex3DWOLS8b4w,https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3027763236_16.jpg
Lemuria,Optometry,"Electronic, Psychedelic, Experimental","Lemuria feels like a sci-fi sound diary built by two people pushing themselves creatively in the same room for the first time. John Tejada’s years of electronic production and March Adstrum’s indie-leaning vocals intersect in songs that shift from dystopian synth pop to post-punk-tinged rhythms, while lyrics pull from diary entries and personal themes of loss and rebirth.",John Tejada; Depeche Mode; Nine Inch Nails; New Order; Soft Cell,https://open.spotify.com/album/2VzigJNr2zcbQANJQannxC?si=Z40mVoutRo2YuJZS7idjmg,https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a1713205011_16.jpg
Blizzard,Dove Ellis,Indie Folk,"Blizzard lands as a stunning and surprising debut from an Irish singer-songwriter who is almost mysterious by design. Dove Ellis blends intimate folk-rock with expressive, dynamic vocals that range from hushed and vulnerable to full-throated and urgent, making songs feel emotionally alive throughout. There’s a rich mix of instrumentation here — from piano and cello to accordion and layered guitars",PJ Harvey; Sharon Van Etten; Aldous Harding; Laura Marling; Cat Power,https://open.spotify.com/album/3Brw2Xdmo6VRPWwOBNye0i?si=pc90B0WWTXe-IPUA3p1wVQ,https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/6932ea9fdf4d8d2973aa26e6/1:1/w_450%2Cc_limit/Dove-Ellis-Blizzard.jpeg
2,Foxwarren,Indie,"You still hear the warmth of melody and Andy Shauf’s distinctive voice, but it’s surrounded by the Kissick's hip-hop-inspired drums, flutes, film-like dialogue snippets, and playful production choices that keep it feeling lively and unpredictable. Some tracks hit with punchy rhythms and catchy bass lines, while others drift into dreamy, collage-like moments that reward listening closely. Very fun, very inventive!

I Love My Computer,ninjarachi,"Electronic, Hyperpop","Pure digital joy. Loud, shiny, a little unhinged, and completely sincere about loving the internet and living inside it.
