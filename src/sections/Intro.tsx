      <h1>Top Music of 2025</h1>
      <p>
        Thanks for joining me on this musical journey through 2025! I am really grateful to have 
        had the chance to discover and share so many incredible albums and songs released this year. 
        I hope you find some new favorites among my top picks and enjoy exploring the vibrant soundscape.
        <br /> <br />

        Please select Top Albums or Top Songs to see, and inside Top Songs is a link to a Spotify playlist
        that I mixed for your enjoyment! 
        <br /> <br />

        Thank you, and here's to good listening in 2026!
        in music.
